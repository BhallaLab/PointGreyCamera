With maximum resolution of 1280x1028, maximum frame rate achievavle was about 40
to 55 FPS. Reduced the resolution to half and FPS went upto 60 FPS.

To increase FPS further, I turn off auto-exposure and set it to 2000 uS. At this
value, I get FPS ~77. Reducing auto-exposure futher does not imporve FPS. With
lighterning condition of my desk, the picture acquired was decent.
